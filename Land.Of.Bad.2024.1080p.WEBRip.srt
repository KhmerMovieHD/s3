0
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,160
The loading operations are finish,
half ready for take-off.

1
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,480
There a problem, Sergeant?

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
No, sir...

3
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,840
Sorry, I was just, uh...

4
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,919
Get your shit together.
We lift off in five.

5
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,720
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,120
Hey, you're HALO qualified, yeah?

7
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
HALO?

8
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
No, sir.

9
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
Are we doing a HALO jump?

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
You'll be fine.

11
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
I'd go Fruit Loops.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,840
My daughter loves them.

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Lieutenant Mitchell reporting.
I repeat.

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,720
Lieutenant Mitchell reporting.

15
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,920
Ah, fuck.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,800
Going after a CIA asset
that's been captured.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,480
The plan is to extract him
with minimal casualties.

18
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,559
He was gathering intel on Alexander
Petrov, a Russian arms dealer

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,720
and former KGB.

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
What's up?

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
That your family?

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Nah, just a pic that came with the helmet.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,680
Yeah. Wife and kids.

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Nice.

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
Are those the new 5.11 tactical gloves?

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,480
You know the ones with the Kevlar knit?

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,080
Yeah, yeah. Kevlar knit.

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Awesome.

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
JTAC,

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,400
just try to relax, okay?

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,600
Right back the other way on
the Euro and gets that one to go.

32
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,680
And the whistle too...

33
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
That bad?

34
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
Yeah, that bad.

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,880
Do you wanna talk about it?

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Wanna hug?

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
We can hug.

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
You need me?

39
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,080
Yeah, I wanted to ask you something, but...

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,920
Okay. Coffee?

41
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Sure.

42
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,200
Okay.

43
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Yeah.

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Cool.

45
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
So, uh,

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,136
you know the wedding's coming up, right?

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,439
Yes, I do. Twenty-third.

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
That's right.

49
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,256
You're not gonna change the date, are you?

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,760
What?

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,736
I've got everything organized.
I got the kids in place.

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,719
I got the ex-wives in place.

53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,480
- Lucy will be out of the hospital.
- Reaper.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
I'm not going to change the date. I,

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,040
um, actually wanted to talk
to you about something else.

56
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,920
I wanted to ask...

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
Who moved my shit?

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Airman...

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,400
who moved my shit?

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,040
Huh?

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,840
Coffee pods.

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,800
I... I don't know, sir. I use the drip.

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,680
Well, I can't trust a
word you say then, can I?

64
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Yeah.

65
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,480
I take the time.

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,160
Every goddamn morning.

67
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
I do it

68
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,360
for efficiency,

69
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,399
easy recognition,

70
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,680
and organization.

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,480
Is it appreciated?

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,480
No.

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,600
It is respected.

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
I think not.

75
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,480
But I do it

76
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
for the morale

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
of the squadron.

78
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
You were saying?

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
Op starts in 15.

80
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,320
Yeah, yeah. I thought you
wanted to talk about something.

81
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,920
It can wait.

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Shit.

83
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,720
You lose something?

84
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,600
Ah, just my cereal.

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,520
Your what?

86
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Froot Loops.

87
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I had a box of Froot Loops. I
don't know what I did with it.

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,320
Jesus Christ, Air Force.

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,800
Barely started this op and you're already
sweating about a box of Frosted Flakes.

90
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,760
No, no. It was... it was Froot Loops.

91
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
Huh?

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Froot Loops, not Frosted Flakes.

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,480
This kid for real?

94
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
Don't be an asshole.

95
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
That's cute.

96
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Thanks, man.

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,040
Fucking Fruit Loops.

98
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,040
How old are you, Air Force?

99
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
Twenty-seven.

100
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Ah...

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,600
Bishop, how old's your
daughter now? Twenty?

102
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,280
You should set Air Force up on a date.

103
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,240
Yeah. I will shoot you in the
dick, Abell. I swear to God.

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,680
No, honey.

105
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,360
I can't.

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
I can't come.

107
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,160
'Cause I gotta be here

108
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,520
at work. Yeah.

109
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,160
Look, just get your sister to go.

110
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
What about your mom?

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,320
All right. Well, why don't you call...?

112
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,560
Oh, you called Judy? Uh...

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
look, okay, okay.

114
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,320
If it's only a couple
of things, that's fine.

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,480
That's fine. But right now, I gotta go

116
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
'cause I got a mission, yeah?

117
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,200
Zegler a little teardrop.

118
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,919
You know I don't like
that shot in college, right?

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,080
It's made about thirt... yeah,

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,599
it's made about 37
percent of the time.

121
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Fuck.

122
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,360
Zegler just settled for a tough
floater on the first side of the floor.

123
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Guys.

124
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
I got a favor to ask you.

125
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,520
My wife is pregnant.

126
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
While I'm on OP, if she goes into
labor, she's gonna call that phone.

127
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
All right?

128
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,560
You need to answer it,

129
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,880
and you need to come and get me.

130
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Copy?

131
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Thank you very much.

132
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,800
And why don't we just keep
this volume down to a low level?

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,000
Because this is a
professional work environment.

134
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
Now, now. Just because your team

135
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,280
delivered the biggest choke
in March Madness history,

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,800
doesn't mean the rest of
us can't still enjoy ourselves.

137
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,320
It's about Lucy. Virgil, it's important.

138
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
I know.

139
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Notice the, uh,

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,720
pseudofolliculitis

141
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
barbae hasn't

142
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
cleared up.

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
Not yet, sir. No.

144
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,280
Well, you just let me know
when you're ready to shave.

145
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,160
I will, sir.

146
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
All right.

147
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
- Go, Vols!
- Go, Vols!

148
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,079
Warhawk, this is Blackbird
approaching drop zone.

149
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,880
Headed to 15,000 feet.

150
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,599
Six minutes to the DZ.

151
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Winds are five knots and to the southeast.

152
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
Skies are clear.

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,840
Happy hunting.

154
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,800
All right, boys. Six minutes.

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Here we go.

156
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,120
Fruit Loop, now's the time
to be checking your weapon.

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm good.

158
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,920
Not your Gameboy. Your actual weapon.

159
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,120
Hey, look, I'm in
charge of the drone. So...

160
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,679
if we wind up in a
situation and I'm shooting,

161
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,240
we got big fucking problems.

162
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,640
You're not wrong.

163
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,360
You're not wrong. JTAC's only good for one
thing and that is... "Bringing the rain."

164
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,319
Is this your first mission
in theater, JTAC?

165
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Second.

166
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,880
But first with operators.

167
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
What?

168
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
Hell, I'll say it. Um...

169
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,440
we're about to head into a shit storm.

170
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
You still look like you kind of
need someone to wipe your ass.

171
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,720
So just... do me a favor.

172
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,480
Keep up and don't fuck up.

173
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,200
Last thing we need in this
op is to have to save your ass.

174
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
Nah, he's good.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey,

176
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,520
remember your training.

177
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,799
Talk to the planes.

178
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,560
When they start dropping bombs,
make sure it's on the bad guys.

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Yes, sir.

180
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,440
You're not going to need these.

181
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,000
This is a sterilized op.

182
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,296
Be advised we are approaching...

183
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,400
All right, boys. Let's put our
masks on. Let's get to work.

184
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,360
Hey, JTAC,

185
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,120
this might sound stupid but
don't forget to breathe, yeah?

186
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,599
Stay on your comms.

187
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
When that hits 3,000,

188
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,440
deploy your chute.

189
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,199
It's just the same as airborne,

190
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,160
only way fucking higher.

191
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Good to go.

192
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,840
I'll see you fuckers on the beach.

193
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Yee-haw.

194
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,880
Hey,

195
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,440
walk in the park.

196
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Fuck.

197
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
You good?

198
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,800
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

199
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
That ridge.

200
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,640
Four clicks by 0800.

201
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
Let's go. Let's move.

202
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
All right.

203
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,240
Sir,

204
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Thank you, Miller.

205
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,560
Okay, team has landed.

206
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,440
Operators are en route.

207
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,160
The drone is ten mics
out from rendezvous point

208
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,560
and Warhawk is switching comms.

209
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,880
This carriage is about
to turn into a pumpkin.

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,560
This is not my chair.

211
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,720
Yes, it is.

212
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,839
No, it is not.

213
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,920
Oh, my god, Reaper, I
did not take your chair.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,040
I know you didn't take my chair.

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,320
It will be these commie
assholes from Shadow Flight.

216
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,240
You finished?

217
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
No, I'm not.

218
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,520
Eat a bag of dicks.

219
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,680
Now I'm finished.

220
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Okay.

221
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,880
All right, let's take
this lady to the dance.

222
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,400
Playboy 06, this is
Reaper 1-0 checking in...

223
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,760
You have 1 MQ-9 in the air.

224
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,480
1 by BLU 118 on board.
Eight hours of playtime ahead.

225
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,759
Reaper 1-0, this is Playboy
0-6. Stand by for grid, over.

226
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,400
Roger. Standing by.

227
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
Grid as follows,

228
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,880
…November, Victor,
7, Niner, 5-7-1-8.

229
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
That's a friendly grid.

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,120
Roger, Playboy. I have
visual on friendly grid.

231
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,560
I am your eyes in the sky
and the bringer of doom.

232
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Over.

233
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,600
Reaper is airborne.
Our location is confirmed.

234
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,720
What's the ordinance?

235
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,880
Two hellfire's and a BLUE-118, sir.

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,600
Lose the sir shit. I work for a living.

237
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,840
It's Sugar or Sug.

238
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
All right.

239
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,720
Makes him feel old.

240
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,640
He is old.

241
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,120
Thanks, Air Force.

242
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Hey, JTAC.

243
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
What rock did they find you under?

244
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,880
In Guam on a training exercise.

245
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,600
Missed the flight out.

246
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,400
That was

247
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
nine hours ago.

248
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,920
How'd you miss the flight?

249
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,720
I had some stomach issues.

250
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,400
Wait.

251
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,840
You're here 'cause you had the shits?

252
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,680
Well, I hope you got
that all cleared out.

253
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,120
You shit your pants on an op,

254
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,040
that stain will follow you for life.

255
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,880
Did you get briefed?

256
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,440
Yeah, but I'm a little confused.

257
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
What about?

258
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
Well, I'm not tier one.

259
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,800
Yet he walks amongst us.

260
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
I thought operators don't go
out without tier one personnel.

261
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
We don't.

262
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,360
So why am I here?

263
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,920
A JSOC asset disappeared two weeks ago.

264
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,920
Believed to be kidnapped.

265
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:18,000
We've got intel on a possible locale.

266
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
So this is a rescue op?

267
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Potentially.

268
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,520
Ah.

269
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,840
You can never keep up
with these CIA spooks.

270
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,920
Either way... here we are.

271
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,800
So to answer your question...

272
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,400
no, you shouldn't be here.

273
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,640
And, yes,

274
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,920
Delta doesn't usually go out
without their tier one personnel.

275
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
And, yes,

276
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,760
if our guy is here,

277
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,840
then we'll go in and fucking get him.

278
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,880
Translation...

279
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,120
step up your game.

280
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,440
I need someone to cover.

281
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Yeah.

282
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,160
I gotta check in with Lucy.

283
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
How's she doing?

284
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,480
She's fantastic.

285
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
Got the baby brain going on though.

286
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,120
I gotta repeat everything five times.

287
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,280
It's amazing.

288
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,000
Absolutely huge.

289
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,800
Got the same thing about this wedding.

290
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,120
Uh, it's understandable.

291
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,520
There's a lot of detail.

292
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
You think about it.

293
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,720
A wedding is probably the
greatest social ritual humanity has.

294
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
You know,

295
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,520
most important day of your life.

296
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,880
Might as well get it right.

297
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,400
You're only going to do it once.

298
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,920
Reaper, you've been married four times.

299
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,640
Yeah, that's just me though.

300
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm a romantic.

301
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
What did you want to ask me before?

302
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,200
Oh, I...

303
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Hold that thought.

304
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,440
Thank you, Miller.

305
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Reaper.

306
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Hey, what's up?

307
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,360
Ah, this fucking frag is a pain in my ass.

308
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,200
Thought you got that patched up.

309
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
I did.

310
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,800
So why are you still bitching about it?

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,240
There's still a fucking
hole in my leg, asshole.

312
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
What happened?

313
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
I.E.D.

314
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
Some kid triggered
it from half a click out.

315
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,920
We never stood a chance.

316
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,600
Therein lies the problem, Fruit Loop.

317
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,040
All this tech, it takes

318
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,680
the
human element out of warfare.

319
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,680
And what happens when all that shit fails?

320
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Well...

321
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Well, what?

322
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,320
I don't know. I mean,

323
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I think this tech saves lives.

324
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,400
In a way, it's takes the
barbaric nature out of it.

325
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,640
Barbaric nature?

326
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Lipstick on a pig.

327
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,280
You really think you dropping a bomb on 50 people
is any better than us shooting them in the head?

328
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
No.

329
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,600
No. War is barbaric.

330
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,360
It ain't never gonna fucking change.

331
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
It already has.

332
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,360
Listen up, Fruit Loop.

333
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,800
Let me tell you a story.

334
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,760
You can fight with all your robots and
your reapers and cell phones you want.

335
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,760
The end of the day,

336
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,800
when the technology fails

337
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,640
and all your...

338
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,440
Your batteries and your bullets
and your bombs run out, you know,

339
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,400
and the fucking sun explodes,

340
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
war comes down to one very simple thing.

341
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,040
And that's man killing man.

342
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,920
Just takes one shit day to
change your whole perspective.

343
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,720
That's a fact.

344
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,760
Yeah.

345
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
Welcome to the land of bad.

346
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
Fucking great story, man.

347
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,680
Really fucking good, rich and compelling.

348
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,480
What do you got?

349
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,800
I got movement.

350
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Hundred meters.

351
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,400
Just the other side of those rocks.

352
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,520
I need eyes over that ridge.
Hundred meters northeast.

353
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,320
Reaper 1-0, this is Playboy 0-6.

354
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,920
Got suspicious movement a hundred meters
northeast of our position. Can you check it out?

355
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,040
Roger that, Playboy. Standby.

356
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,480
Hundred meters southeast.

357
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,560
Got good handshake.

358
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,000
Reaper 1-0, can you zoom in?

359
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,440
Copy that.

360
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,920
Yeah, oh, that's sexy.

361
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
Pan left, 50 meters.

362
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Pan left, 50 meters.

363
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
What the fuck?

364
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,799
Reaper, I'm hollow, over.

365
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
Roger. Standby.

366
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,160
Systems malfunction.

367
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,520
Goddamn piece of shit.

368
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,120
Playboy, we have a systems
malfunction on the bird.

369
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,200
Copy that. Is the pod inop?

370
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,200
That is an a-firm, Playboy. We got
to get this piece of shit back to base.

371
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,800
Is another bird available?

372
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,800
That is a negative.

373
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,280
We'll fix this one up and
get it back to you stat.

374
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,480
Reapers down. No other UAV's available.

375
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,640
Broken Reaper, huh?

376
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,800
Ain't that some fuckin' irony?

377
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,559
Looks like we're gonna have to clear this ridge
the old-fashioned way. Abell, you're on point.

378
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,080
Copy.

379
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,760
Bishop,

380
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,440
you're left.

381
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,600
Copy.

382
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,160
What's the rest of our air support?

383
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,320
Hornet's on standby. Thirty mikes out.

384
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,760
What do you want me to do?

385
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Nothing.

386
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,080
I got nothing on my end.

387
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,080
Same here.

388
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,000
Looks clear.

389
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Wait.

390
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,760
Wait, I've got movement.

391
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,720
Ten meters.

392
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Oh, for fuck's sake.

393
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,640
It's a fucking oink oink.

394
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,080
What the hell's an oink oink?

395
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,160
A fucking pig, dumbass.

396
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,040
Pretty sure you got a
picture of her in your wallet.

397
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,800
Fucker.

398
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,200
This is serious bad guy lair shit.

399
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Got two tangos on the bridge.

400
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,119
A third on the far right.

401
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,360
Other side of the tent.

402
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,240
See a Starbucks down there?

403
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,520
I see number four on the
lower part of the S-bend road

404
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,360
Let's push down.

405
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Okay. Clear.

406
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Clear.

407
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,200
Okay. We're gonna call this OP1. Air Force,

408
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,480
set up up top.

409
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,560
Abell, you stay put.
Set up your hindsight.

410
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,200
Bishop, you're with me.

411
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,120
We're gonna wrap around southeast.

412
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,359
Hooah.

413
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,920
You good?

414
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,680
Yeah, I think so.

415
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,240
Okay. Go forth and conquer.

416
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
All right, gents.

417
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Sit tight.

418
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,760
Call out what you see. want a head count
on that compound before we move on it.

419
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Sug?

420
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
When can we get a nice gig in Hawaii?

421
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,080
Sick of swamp crotch.

422
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,920
I don't think they'd allow you
back in Hawaii since last time.

423
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,800
That was

424
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,640
one time.

425
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,160
Piece of shit. Fucking.

426
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,560
Got movement.

427
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,240
All right, this sure looks like our guy.

428
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
Bishop, can you confirm?

429
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,880
Yeah, that's Petrov all right.

430
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,160
Okay,

431
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
if he's here,

432
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,160
the asset's gotta be close.

433
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
Thunderbolt Squadron?

434
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,080
No, it's not.

435
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,720
I'm sorry I can't do that for you.

436
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,640
You're gonna have to
call the operator back.

437
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,880
If you ask for extension 141,
that's Thunderbolt. Uh-huh.

438
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,560
Yeah, no problem.

439
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Guys...

440
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,000
what the fuck?

441
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,640
What's the problem, Captain?

442
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,200
I asked you to keep an ear on this phone.

443
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,760
Some smartass turned
the goddamn ringer off.

444
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,040
Why don't you turn it back on?

445
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
I have

446
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,720
Is your wife actually in labor, Captain?

447
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,680
On the precipice, sir.

448
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,920
Water's broken?

449
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Impending.

450
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,840
Having any of those, uh,

451
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,840
contractions?

452
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,440
Well, since you asked,

453
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
right now,

454
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,040
40 mics apart.

455
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,880
Last night, she was tooting like

456
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,280
a bugler at a Gettysburg reenactment.

457
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,160
Currently, her cervix is

458
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,519
two centimeters dilated
and starting to yawn.

459
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120
All right, that is too much information.

460
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,200
Yes, it is, sir.

461
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,680
Airmen, for the love of God,
make sure that phone's turned on.

462
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Thank you.

463
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
Contact.

464
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,200
Multiple vehicles
inbound. Eleven o'clock.

465
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,640
Oh, Petrov is on the move.

466
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,160
Who the hell are these guys?

467
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,120
Identify yourselves!

468
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Don't know.

469
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,800
Local militia?

470
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Kinda looks like Abu Sayyaf.

471
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Bishop, can you confirm?

472
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,480
Yeah, I can't tell.

473
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,280
More guys with guns.

474
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,200
Sure as shit ain't taking
this compound 'til they leave.

475
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,440
Check out the dude getting out
the left side of the lead vehicle.

476
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,200
Tell me that doesn't
look like Saeed Hashimi.

477
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Fuck.

478
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Who's that?

479
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,080
Head of Abu Sayyaf.

480
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,080
Sure he's here to buy guns.

481
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,400
Keep your eyes open.

482
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,840
Guns on safety.

483
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,280
JTAC, what's the status of our air?

484
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,560
Reaper still down, Hornet on standby.

485
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
You want it airborne?

486
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,160
Negative.

487
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,520
Sit tight. Let me work
on a new game plan.

488
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,080
Yo,

489
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,200
drone's fixed.

490
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,560
Handover in five.

491
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
I'm ready.

492
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Fuck.

493
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Playboy,

494
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,360
this is Reaper 1-0, back
on station. Checking in.

495
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,760
Requesting permission to establish overhead

496
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,720
Copy that. Good to have you back, Reaper.

497
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,800
Grid is as follows,

498
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,640
November, Victor,
1-1-4-8-7-6-3-5. Over.

499
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,320
Copy grid, Playboy.

500
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,920
I have contact.

501
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,040
Open circular compound,
one large concrete structure,

502
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,360
and a road heading north crossing a dam.

503
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,160
Confirm target area.

504
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,240
Roger that, you have target area in sight.

505
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,120
I didn't know Hashimi
was in bed with Petrov.

506
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,920
Oh, Hashimi's a terrorist.

507
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,400
He's got to buy his guns from somewhere

508
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Come.

509
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,480
Come here.

510
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,920
The miss doesn't
look too thrilled about it.

511
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,320
Yeah, this guy's definitely a creeper.

512
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,200
She's getting stranger
danger vibes for sure.

513
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,320
Hashimi and Petrov sitting in a tree

514
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,600
K-I-S-S...

515
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Fuck.

516
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,800
Go away!

517
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,360
Run! Run, run, run.

518
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Oh, fuck.

519
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,600
Take him!

520
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Run!

521
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,599
What the fuck, Sugar?
What are we doing?

522
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,080
Warhawk, this is Alpha 1.

523
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,480
Have hostiles engaging with
civilians. Requesting updated

524
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,040
Make him see.

525
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,600
Allahu Akbar!

526
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Fuck me.

527
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,320
Oh fuck...

528
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,520
Motherfucker!

529
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,520
Jesus Christ!

530
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
Petrov,

531
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,560
Papa!

532
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,240
Fuck this, Sugar, I ain't watching
this asshole lob off the kid's head.

533
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Papa!

534
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,680
Kinney, stand by for
potential diversion.

535
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,079
Reaper, we need weapons effects
between the compound and the tent. Over.

536
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,160
Reaper 1-0. One by
hellfire missile, copied.

537
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Papa!

538
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,240
Abell, Bishop, you got a shot, you
take it. Kinney, drop that fucking bomb.

539
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,800
Reaper, you are cleared hot!
Say again, you are cleared hot!

540
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Copied.

541
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,880
Target acquired.

542
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,640
Weapon's away. Impact 30 seconds.

543
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,360
No! Papa!

544
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,480
Don't have thirty.

545
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Run!

546
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,800
Run, kid. Run!

547
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Guys?

548
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,600
It's a fucking cave entrance.

549
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,120
Kinney, you've got hostiles directly below
you. Do not move. Do not even breathe.

550
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,040
Abell, Bishop,

551
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,760
I need sights on targets.

552
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,520
Abell, you taking center. Bishop,
extreme left. I'm on extreme right.

553
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,520
On one...

554
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
In position.

555
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,760
On one.

556
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Three

557
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,680
two,

558
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
one,

559
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Kinney!

560
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Fuck!

561
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,640
Shit. Abell, you've got five
hostiles on your six. Fifty meters.

562
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,559
Bishop, move. On me!

563
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
All right, Abell.

564
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,160
Kinney, I need...

565
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,040
Stay still, asshole.

566
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,199
A little help here, fellas!

567
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,560
Trying, buddy.

568
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,440
Kinney, I need you to lay
down some cover fire for Abell.

569
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,000
Sug...

570
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,520
Yeah.

571
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
We got a situation.

572
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,080
No shit.

573
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,160
We got another situation.
RPG twelve o'clock. Incoming!

574
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,800
Motherfucker!

575
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,320
Motherfucker!

576
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,080
I got you, man. I got you.

577
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Okay.

578
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
You're good, man.

579
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,601
No, you're good, man. You're
good. You're good. I got you.

580
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,360
Where's the med kit?

581
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,480
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

582
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,240
Come on, man. Where's the med kit?

583
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Kinney.

584
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Kinney.

585
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,759
Abell, Abell. No, no, no.

586
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,520
Fuck, fuck. Oh, fuck!

587
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,640
Abell is down. Abell is down.

588
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Hello?

589
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,680
Oh, fuck.

590
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Oh, fuck. Alpha 1, this Playboy.

591
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,840
Kinney,

592
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
listen to me.

593
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,040
We are taking heavy fire
from two two-man RPG teams.

594
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,840
I need some bombs down there now!

595
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,640
Wait, wh-what about Abell?

596
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,280
Abell is dead.

597
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,520
He's dead. I need you to stay
focused, Sergeant. Get yourself together.

598
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
Oh, fuck.

599
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,759
Reaper, we're taking RPG fire on
the southeast side

600
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,359
of the compound. Two hundred
meters south of my position.

601
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,200
Give me the biggest
thing you got. Cleared hot.

602
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,560
Copy that, Playboy. We
have eyes on the target.

603
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,840
1 by Blu 118.

604
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Weapons away.

605
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,160
Impact 20 seconds.

606
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,520
Where's that bomb, Sergeant?

607
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,920
Twenty seconds!

608
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
RPG incoming!

609
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,840
Fuck! Sugar?

610
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,600
Sugar? Bishop!

611
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
Oh, shit.

612
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,280
Fuck!

613
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,200
You got eyes on him?

614
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,560
Lost him in the smoke.

615
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,560
Fuck.

616
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,680
Did he pop the smoke?

617
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
I don't know.

618
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,520
Playboy, do you copy?

619
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,400
I see him.

620
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
Stay with him.

621
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,760
Reaper? Reaper, you there?

622
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
Reaper?

623
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,200
Reaper, you there?

624
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,160
We're here, Playboy.

625
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Give me the status of your team.

626
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,520
Uh,

627
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,120
KIA.

628
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
Okay, Playboy, let's

629
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,600
do this by the numbers.

630
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,920
Confirm your current grid location.

631
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Yeah.

632
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
Uh,

633
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:29,160
I'm headed northeast.
November, Romeo, 2-7-6-0-niner-3-2-2.

634
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm, uh...

635
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,760
I'm approx

636
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,920
five clicks from the evac point.

637
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,440
I need you to scan forward 500
meters and make sure the area is clear.

638
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,840
Copy, Playboy. We got you.

639
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,080
Scanning forward 500 meters. Standby.

640
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,680
Yeah, area's clear.

641
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
Area looks clear. You're good to move.

642
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,360
Playboy, do you copy?

643
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Playboy?

644
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,240
What's he doing? Is he moving?

645
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,320
He's freaking out.

646
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,040
You gotta calm him down.

647
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,680
Hey, Playboy. Good news.

648
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,200
Helicopter is inbound to the evac
point. The cavalry is on the way.

649
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,920
You gotta get your ass on the move, son.

650
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,760
You got to move, man. Let's go.

651
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,880
Come on, soldier.

652
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,520
Get up and go.

653
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,400
Here we go. All right.

654
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,320
You scan forward. I've got him.

655
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,480
Scanning forward.

656
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,800
Tell me what you see.

657
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
Reaper,

658
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,680
I think I'm hearing a truck.

659
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
He's right.

660
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,560
I have contact from the west.

661
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,880
Truck on the road, half a click.

662
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,800
I have contact from the east.

663
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,880
Looks like they're converging
on Playboy's position.

664
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,040
Playboy, be aware. You have
converging targets east and west.

665
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,696
How much ordinance do you have left?

666
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,080
One by hellfire. Air to
ground 114. Standing by.

667
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,919
You want those hornets airborne?

668
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,120
Negative.

669
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,360
Okay, Playboy, tally. Eyes
on target. What you want to do?

670
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,600
Keep eyes on it.

671
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,320
Roger that. Standing by.

672
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,680
Reaper, do you have eyes on hostiles?

673
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,760
Confirmed hostiles from the east are armed.

674
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,800
Are they Abu Sayyaf?

675
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,440
They've got weapons.
Safe to assume.

676
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,680
Playboy, you copy?

677
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,200
Can't talk right now.

678
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,800
Ah, for fuck's sake. Playboy, Playboy.

679
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,440
Canine coming your way.

680
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,640
You gotta be shitting me.

681
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,840
Git.

682
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,320
Fuck, Playboy.

683
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,800
Buffalo Bill has dismounted.
He is approaching your position.

684
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,520
Looks like he's coming towards Lassie.

685
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,040
Do not move.

686
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,760
Playboy,

687
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,360
Buffalo Bill is above your
position. Do not move.

688
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,760
Okay, Playboy. Looks
like Lassie's going home.

689
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Buffalo Bill has remounted.

690
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,600
Hostiles are leaving the party. Stand by.

691
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,120
Goddammit.

692
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,080
Playboy,

693
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,240
Buffalo Bill and his buddy
are gone. The truck is gone.

694
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,360
You are clear tracking
500 meters to your north.

695
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,160
There's a path up that
ridge on your one o'clock.

696
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Hey, Playboy,

697
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,040
how you holding up?

698
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
I'm all right.

699
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,160
Where are you from, man?

700
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Ohio.

701
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
No shit.

702
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,880
Me, too.

703
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,240
Brook Park.

704
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,560
Middleburg Heights.

705
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,480
We're basically fucking neighbors.

706
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,680
O-H.

707
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,680
I-O.

708
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,680
Fellow Buckeye.

709
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Get home much?

710
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,520
Yeah.

711
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,480
Yeah, I was just there.

712
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,080
Had to bury my father.

713
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,640
Oh, man. Sorry to hear.

714
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,080
Yeah, it's okay.

715
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,520
Were you guys close?

716
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah.

717
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,680
Yeah, he was a good guy.

718
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,120
In Sweet Sixteen news, the fucking Buckeyes

719
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,360
just shit the bed against VCU.

720
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,800
First round.

721
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,920
Trying to depress me more?

722
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Sorry, man.

723
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,400
Hey, you ever got up to
Mama Santas on Mayfield?

724
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,320
Are you kidding me?

725
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,800
I lived at that place during high school.

726
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,360
Fucking great.

727
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,600
I know, right? I met
my first wife there in '95.

728
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,160
Oh, yeah?

729
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,680
Yeah. We met in line.

730
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,280
We both ordered stromboli.

731
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,400
Who the fuck orders stromboli?

732
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
I know, right?

733
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,480
I thought it was meant to be.

734
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
And it was.

735
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,640
Right up until it wasn't,

736
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,880
you know?

737
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,920
My current wife hates the shit.

738
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,920
She jealous?

739
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,840
Nah, man, worse...

740
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,720
she's vegan.

741
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,800
Ah, man. That is worse.

742
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
How do you know if someone's a vegan?

743
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,720
How?

744
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,520
They will tell you.

745
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,720
You're getting really close now,
man. Just keep up the pace. Good work.

746
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,920
ETA on the helo?

747
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,680
Playboy 0-6, this is Blackbird 2-5,

748
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,760
approaching LZ from east.

749
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,400
ETA three mikes, over.

750
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
Copy.

751
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,080
Reaper, how's my path to the LZ?

752
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,400
Clear.

753
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,760
Path is clear.

754
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,160
Time to get the hell
out of dodge, Playboy.

755
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,720
Thanks for the eyes, Reaper.

756
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,160
Happy to do it.

757
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,320
Hey, drop me a line
next time you're in Vegas.

758
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,160
I have a solid hookup for Disney on Ice.

759
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,880
You lost me.

760
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,200
I might pass on that,

761
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,680
but I'm at Nellis all the time.

762
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,879
I'm here, man. Call CENTCOM.

763
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,840
Raven Squadron. Eddie Grim.

764
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,200
Just ask for Reaper.

765
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,560
Will do.

766
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,680
Blackbird 2-5, I have a
visual. LZ is clear for extract.

767
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,280
Marking position with I-R.

768
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,320
Roger that, Playboy. I
have your position marked.

769
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,359
Contact! I'm hit! I'm hit!

770
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,840
Playboy, are you injured?

771
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,440
Negative!

772
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:35,600
Must have hit my plate.

773
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,119
Reaper, hostiles, 100 meters
east. Two hundred meters south.

774
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,480
Contact! Blackbird. I have
multiple targets around the LZ.

775
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,640
Contact, Blackbird. Three
more hostiles on the west ridge

776
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,240
Small arms and an RPG.

777
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,560
Better move your ass.

778
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,520
RPG!

779
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,040
Shit!

780
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,400
Blackbird, can you stay in the
area until we can find a secure LZ?

781
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,479
Negative, Playboy.
LZ is too hot.

782
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,280
Back to you as fast as we can.

783
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
Shit!

784
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,919
Reaper, west ridge.

785
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,080
Contact, Playboy.

786
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,880
Three more trucks right through.

787
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,400
Reaper, need the bomb
300 meters to the west.

788
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,080
Cleared hot!

789
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,480
Roger that, Playboy.

790
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,560
Tally. Eyes on target.

791
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,040
Stay where you are, assholes.

792
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,000
Stay where you are, assholes.

793
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,360
Weapon away. Impact 20 seconds.

794
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,920
Target is down. Now
get the fuck out of there.

795
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,039
Fuck! Taking fire.

796
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,920
This ain't done.

797
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:52,120
Got another truck
coming in from the west.

798
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,880
Jesus Christ, I'm pinned down.

799
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,639
How are they seeing me?

800
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,480
It's his strobe!

801
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,040
They must have night vision.
He's gotta turn his strobe off.

802
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,799
It's your strobe, Playboy.
Turn off your strobe.

803
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,320
Taking fire from the east.
Drop everything you have.

804
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,640
Playboy, I am Winchester.
I'm out of bombs.

805
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,360
ETA on the hornets is two mikes.

806
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,199
Playboy... this is Hornet 1.

807
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,120
Entering point out level.

808
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:21,280
I'm coming in on an east west heading.

809
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,720
Roger that, Hornet 1.

810
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,679
I'm 200 meters north of target
grid.

811
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,640
Keep all fire south of target grid.

812
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,400
I say again, all fire south.

813
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,680
Copy that. Be advised
this will be danger close.

814
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,160
Yes, yes. Cleared hot.

815
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,160
Copy.

816
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,240
Three, two, one!

817
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,480
Shit!

818
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,120
Still taking fire from west!

819
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,240
Copy, Playboy. Coming
around for another run.

820
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Fuck!

821
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,480
Fuck this!

822
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,360
What do you want, Airman?

823
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,799
- Yeah, I'm doing a Starbucks run.
- Moving!

824
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,160
Colonel Packett is springing.

825
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,880
A what?

826
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,600
Starbucks.

827
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:23,119
Have you lost your mind?

828
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,120
Airman, leave!

829
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,280
Eyes on that hornet.

830
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,519
Give me some fire on the west ridge.

831
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,760
You're cleared hot.

832
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
Confirm. West or east?

833
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,080
West! West!

834
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,279
Copy that. This one is
going to be danger close.

835
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,880
We still do not have visual on you.

836
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,639
It's fine. Just drop
it! You're cleared hot!

837
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,520
Be advised, this is danger close.

838
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,240
Altitude.

839
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,280
Altitude.

840
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,360
Pull up.

841
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,240
Pull up.

842
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,320
Playboy, I am Winchester.

843
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,120
Hornet 1 is RTB.

844
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,800
Copy that.

845
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,280
Good shooting.

846
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,039
How's it looking, Reaper?

847
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,720
Playboy, from what we
can see, it looks clear.

848
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,680
These fuckers know
we're out there now, so...

849
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,680
do not discount any surprises.

850
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,079
We got another LZ?

851
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,200
There's a clearing

852
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,880
two clicks northeast
of your position.

853
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,600
You're not gonna like it though.

854
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,280
You say northeast?

855
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,160
A-firm, Playboy.

856
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,160
Northeast is up a big fucking hill.

857
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,200
I know, man. I told you,
you weren't gonna like it.

858
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,320
I'm sorry, but that is the
closest LZ option we have.

859
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,920
Playboy, the helo is airborne.

860
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,280
ETA to the alternate
LZ is 90 mikes.

861
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,320
You copy?

862
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,840
Yeah, I'm here.

863
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,480
How you doing, man?

864
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,120
Pretty gassed.

865
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,760
Yeah, no doubt.

866
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,680
Hang in there, okay?

867
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,680
Sorry about the failed evac, man.

868
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,600
Now you know.

869
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,840
Don't trust Air Force Captains.
Traditionally, we are full of shit.

870
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,720
Captain?

871
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,520
Yeah.

872
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,880
You said you met your first wife in '95.

873
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,240
Yeah, I am old as shit. I
should be a general by now.

874
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,240
I got three ex-wives. I got eight kids. I
got a new wife. I got a new kid on the way.

875
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,320
I need the active duty bonuses.

876
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,240
If I go out from Captain, they'll
make me an instructor, so fuck that.

877
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,360
You fly fixed wings before the birds?

878
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,919
That is a very long story, my friend.

879
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,200
But, yes, originally, I
did sign up to be a pilot.

880
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,240
But apparently, the Air Force thought

881
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,240
my responses to authority were not normal.

882
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,480
So that goat got fucked.

883
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,120
Subtle.

884
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,480
What happened?

885
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,439
Well, I shot my big mouth off,

886
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,520
and I found myself
reassigned to USAF-SF

887
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,680
guarding shit in the middle
of nowhere for 20 years.

888
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,720
Eareckson Base in the
Aleutian, Pine Gap in Australia...

889
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,640
Playboy, do you copy?

890
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,400
Playboy, do you copy?

891
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,800
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

892
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,320
What happened?

893
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,640
Slid halfway down
a fucking mountain.

894
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,320
Oh, fuck, man. You okay?

895
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,360
You hurt?

896
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,720
Yeah. Just my pride.

897
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,639
Uh, Reaper, I've got
movement in front of Playboy.

898
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,040
One hundred meters northwest.

899
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,080
Zoom in.

900
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,040
Three armed hostiles.

901
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,919
Playboy, you have three
hostiles heading your way.

902
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,080
Find cover.

903
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Find cover.

904
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,680
Fuck.

905
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,280
Shit.

906
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,719
Scan forward. Keep me with him.

907
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,720
Copy.

908
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,200
Got him?

909
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,440
I'm looking. I'm looking.

910
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,600
Fuck.

911
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,240
I got him

912
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,680
He's heading downstream.

913
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,080
God fucking dammit!

914
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,480
Get me the colonel.

915
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,720
Yeah.

916
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,760
Keep looking.

917
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,840
I lost him under the canopy.

918
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:49,920
Fuck.

919
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,680
Reaper, what's the sitrep?

920
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,480
This mission has
gone to shit, Colonel.

921
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,840
I got an op who's been taken.

922
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,400
We are 12 hours in.

923
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,480
I'm Winchester, but we cannot leave the
target area because we have the only eyes.

924
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,680
Requesting permission to stay in
the chair until we get the soldier home.

925
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,840
How you feeling?
Are you feeling sharp?

926
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:17,840
Oh yeah.

927
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,920
Sharp as an elephant's ass.

928
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,720
Staff Sergeant?

929
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,920
I'm good, sir.

930
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,440
Okay, Eddie. Stay in the chair.

931
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,400
Get it done, you two.

932
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,120
Fuck you.

933
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,480
Come on, Playboy.

934
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,440
Come on. Talk to me.

935
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,400
Oh, shit.

936
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,440
You got him?

937
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,919
It's all radio chatter
about the JSOC asset.

938
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,560
Who?

939
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,240
The reason those guys are there,

940
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,160
not confirmed,

941
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,279
but one says Borneo,
the other Yemen.

942
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,280
Yemen?

943
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,000
That's halfway around the
fucking world. You shitting me?

944
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,799
Who's saying that?

945
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,119
Reading between the lines with CIA or DIA.

946
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,120
Man.

947
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,560
Alphabet soup motherfuckers!

948
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,280
You can't trust a word they say.

949
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,320
Hands!

950
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Hands!

951
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Hands!

952
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,640
Are you injured?

953
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:14,560
Look at me.

954
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,200
I thought you were dead.

955
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,160
Here.

956
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,440
Drink this. Drink. Drink. Drink.

957
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,120
Here. Put that on, okay?

958
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,440
Okay?

959
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,920
An RPG exploded on your position.

960
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,880
Near,

961
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,160
not on.

962
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,160
Listen.

963
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,040
Bishop got captured.

964
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,120
He's injured pretty bad.

965
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,440
I gotta go.

966
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,520
We gotta go back and get him.

967
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,280
So,

968
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,800
grab what you can, okay? Here.

969
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,120
Take this. Here.

970
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,040
Put them in here. Put them in here.

971
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,040
Here take this.

972
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,880
Come on.

973
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,640
You following me, Sergeant?

974
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,240
Hey. Look,

975
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,560
I get it.

976
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,480
This is not where you want to be,

977
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,760
but you got to dig, okay?

978
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,400
It's not here. It's not here. It's here.

979
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,120
Bishop's in trouble.

980
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,560
We gotta go back and get him.

981
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,240
Okay.

982
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,920
You can still shoot, can't you?

983
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
Yeah.

984
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,120
Let's go.

985
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,239
Still have your battery?

986
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,640
No, I lost it in the fall.

987
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,400
Let me see your knife.

988
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,560
What for?

989
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,760
I'm gonna call Warhawk.

990
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,280
With a water bottle?

991
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,880
Come on, you piece of shit.

992
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,000
Reaper, this is Playboy

993
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,880
Playboy, where the fuck are you?

994
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,760
I'm with Alpha one.

995
01:07:59,761 --> 01:08:01,136
We're headed back to the initial AO.

996
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,800
No, no, no, no. Negative.
Negative, Playboy.

997
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,480
We have Intel the asset has been found.

998
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,559
We're not going for the asset.

999
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,560
Say again?

1000
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,759
We're not going for the asset. One of our team
members was captured. We're going in to get him.

1001
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,240
Playboy, a QRF is being assembled.
Hold your position until they're deployed.

1002
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,680
Negative, Reaper. There's no time.

1003
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,119
Get on the horn with CJSOTF,
and let them know our sitrep.

1004
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,679
We're gonna need planes on
standby. ETA to target area is 6-0 mikes.

1005
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,080
We'll confirm grid then. Over.

1006
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,760
What direction you heading, Playboy?

1007
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,880
Give me your bearing.

1008
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,480
Playboy?

1009
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,560
Lost comms.

1010
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Fuck!

1011
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,680
Connect me to CJSOTF.

1012
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,120
Well, I know it's unusual, Eileen.
Just fucking connect me, okay?

1013
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
So where is he?

1014
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,360
No idea.

1015
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,800
What's the plan?

1016
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,640
Drop some bombs, create a diversion,

1017
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,920
go in and get him.

1018
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,080
Kill anyone that gets in our way.

1019
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,360
Where do you want the bombs?

1020
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,480
You're the JTAC. You tell me.

1021
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,960
Probably the best place would be along
those cave entrances on this ridge line.

1022
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,400
Space them out 15
minutes apart while we go in.

1023
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Sound good?

1024
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,400
Sounds good.

1025
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,880
Find Bishop, make our
move when the first strike hits.

1026
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,199
Second strike should hold their attention.

1027
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,400
And the last one?

1028
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,680
Mass effect.

1029
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,160
Let's turn those caves inside out.

1030
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,800
Fuckin' A, kid.

1031
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,680
Fuckin' A.

1032
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,920
Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?

1033
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,360
B1 full payload? That will do the job.

1034
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,440
I will confirm

1035
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,360
the 9 line with
Bone 0-1 when received.

1036
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,720
Roger.

1037
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,440
B1 in the air, Colonel.

1038
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,880
Copy that. Nice work.

1039
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,440
Reaper, this is Playboy.

1040
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,800
Copy, Playboy. I'm here.

1041
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,159
Okay. Game plan is to use CAS
to strike a set of cave structures

1042
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,200
to the north of the
compound as a diversion.

1043
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,000
I need three attacks spaced approx
15 mikes apart starting at 1100.

1044
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,280
Eleven hundred. Mark that.

1045
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,720
First strike, 1100.

1046
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,120
Intent for first two attacks
is to hold their attention.

1047
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,680
Final attack should have enough ordnance
to neutralize all enemy in the caves.

1048
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,440
Type three BOC.

1049
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:53,320
November, Victor, 1-1-4-8-7-6-3-5.

1050
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,120
Say again, Playboy. Say again.

1051
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:01,079
November, Victor,
1-1-4-8-7-6-3-5. Over.

1052
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,080
Copy.

1053
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,320
Eyes on you.

1054
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,240
Three strikes. Eleven hundred. Diversion.

1055
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,519
Eleven fifteen, diversion.

1056
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,120
Eleven thirty, we're gonna light
that shit up and blow it to fuck.

1057
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,160
Confirm, Playboy.

1058
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,200
Oh, fuck.

1059
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,480
Battery's dead.

1060
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,640
We good?

1061
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,760
Hope so.

1062
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,040
Playboy, confirm?

1063
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,080
Lost comms.

1064
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,200
Fuck.

1065
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,120
All right, we all know the plan.

1066
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,336
You both did some fine work
here today. Get out of here.

1067
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,360
No, no, no, no, no.

1068
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,560
We are not going anywhere.

1069
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,280
I wasn't asking. You're done.

1070
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,560
You're ten hours over
your eight-hour shift.

1071
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,439
Okay, Reaper. Out of the chair.

1072
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,160
Eat a bag of dicks, Hawkins.

1073
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,080
Hawkins?

1074
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,880
It's Andrews.

1075
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,320
Come on. Let me get you up.

1076
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,680
No.

1077
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,400
Exit the chair, Reaper.

1078
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,920
There's no fucking way I'm off this op.

1079
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,360
No fucking way.

1080
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,919
I got one KIA.

1081
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,920
One MIA.

1082
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,680
And I got two fucking nut jobs

1083
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,160
trying to take on an
entire Abu Sayyaf camp.

1084
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,280
That leaves one team, i.e. us,

1085
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,879
to make sure this whole thing doesn't
go to hell in a fucking handbasket.

1086
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,880
You finished?

1087
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,880
I'm not finished.

1088
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,240
I can keep going.

1089
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,376
Then I suggest you think very carefully about the
next words that come out of your mouth, Captain.

1090
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,440
Oh, come on, Virgil. You're
gonna pull rank on me?

1091
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,080
You told me I could have this chair

1092
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,760
until the op was done.

1093
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,639
Go and watch the basketball.

1094
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,720
Sir, with all due respect, this is
Reaper's op. We should be allowed to...

1095
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,039
I don't recall asking your
opinion, Staff Sergeant.

1096
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,160
Well, maybe that's your problem, Colonel.

1097
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,080
I would strongly advise you to
not go down the same rabbit hole

1098
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,400
as your partner here.

1099
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,400
She did not say a word, Colonel.

1100
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,400
Not a single word.

1101
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,480
Exit the chair.

1102
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,440
Exit the room,

1103
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,840
and I will do my best to forget
this conversation ever happened.

1104
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,680
Don't fuck it up, Junior.

1105
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,160
You got it.

1106
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,720
First strike 1100. It's just a diversion.

1107
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,319
Second strike 11...

1108
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,320
Captain!

1109
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,400
I'm good. I'm good.

1110
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,040
You're dismissed.

1111
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,200
Here we are.

1112
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,880
Eyes.

1113
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,440
One guy in the tent.

1114
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,480
Two guys on the balcony.

1115
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,320
What's our time?

1116
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,360
Twenty.

1117
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,680
This is gonna get ugly.

1118
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,880
I need you focused. Head on a swivel.

1119
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,760
If you see something I don't,

1120
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,400
you say 'contact
left, contact right.'

1121
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,519
Somebody comes from behind us,

1122
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,240
you say 'six.'

1123
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,680
I'll handle the rest.

1124
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,120
Only shoot if it's necessary. We got
to keep this quiet for as long as we can.

1125
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,920
For what it's worth,

1126
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,880
you earned your tier one status today.

1127
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,000
Does that mean I get paid more?

1128
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,920
Fuck no. It just sounds cooler.

1129
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,840
You ready?

1130
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,600
Nope.

1131
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,760
You?

1132
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,800
Always.

1133
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,080
Let's do it.

1134
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,560
Okay.

1135
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,640
Fucker.

1136
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,600
You good?

1137
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,880
Yeah.

1138
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:04,920
Alright.

1139
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,440
He's jammed.

1140
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,519
Go, go, go, go!

1141
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,520
Come on!

1142
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,480
Gun right. Right!

1143
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,400
Move! Move!

1144
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:41,760
On me.

1145
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,920
On you.

1146
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,040
Contact left!

1147
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,480
Drop down!

1148
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,520
You good?

1149
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,760
Fuck!

1150
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,240
Fuck.

1151
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,040
Oh, fuck!

1152
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,000
Grenade!

1153
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,240
Get down!

1154
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,600
Hey, Sug.

1155
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,920
Bishop.

1156
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,240
This your idea of a rescue mission?

1157
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,480
I think I got them right where I want 'em.

1158
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,440
You look like ass.

1159
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,600
Hey,

1160
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,360
how you doing, Bishop?

1161
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,160
Talk to me.

1162
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,480
Ah...

1163
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:16,040
Air Force,

1164
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,640
I think

1165
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,440
we're in a bad spot.

1166
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,240
Yeah, we're in a bad spot.

1167
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,480
Hey!

1168
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,320
Hey!

1169
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,240
Hey, yo!

1170
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,640
Hey, listen to me, man.

1171
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,520
They're gonna drop bombs on
these caves. You understand?

1172
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,119
Bombs on these caves.

1173
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,760
If we don't get out of
here, we're all gonna die.

1174
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,280
You understand?
Bombs on these caves.

1175
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,080
Fuck!

1176
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,560
Stupid fucks!

1177
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,480
Stupid fucks!

1178
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,920
Boeing 0-1, this is Sunburn
0-6. We're tracking your position.

1179
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,720
Be advised ETA to first drone strike,

1180
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,360
two mikes.

1181
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,080
All right, let's fucking rock and roll.

1182
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,840
Zoom out 400 meters.

1183
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,120
I think they know

1184
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,360
I'm not gonna last much longer.

1185
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,896
Just... just... just hang on
a second, all right, man?

1186
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,639
I'm gonna figure out
how to get us out of here.

1187
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,040
I'm already out.

1188
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,480
Just get Bishop and get
yourselves out of here.

1189
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,160
Okay?

1190
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,760
Nah, you're good, man.
You're good, you're good.

1191
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,040
Don't...

1192
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,719
fucking touch him!

1193
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,239
Or I'll fucking fucking fuck!

1194
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,240
Fuck!

1195
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,880
Fucking pieces of shit!

1196
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,680
Come on!

1197
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,560
Get your fucking hands off him!

1198
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,520
Fucking coward.

1199
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,920
Sugar?

1200
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,200
Get your fucking hands off him!

1201
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,320
Hashimi,

1202
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,120
you like that?

1203
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,480
Sugar?

1204
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,600
Oh, fuck.

1205
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,240
Sugar?

1206
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,320
I'm good.

1207
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,760
Fuck!

1208
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,840
Fuck!

1209
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,760
Welcome to Guantanamo.

1210
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,320
Go.

1211
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,880
You know Japan invaded these lands in 1941.

1212
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,720
Hm. Built these caves
with the intent to stay

1213
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,200
but our Moro brothers
defeated them very quickly. Hm.

1214
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,920
You know this dam they built...

1215
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,720
it was a very forward step.

1216
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,760
Was it this blood

1217
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,200
washed from the land

1218
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,400
and into our mouths?

1219
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,920
But not to me.

1220
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,360
We answer to no one but ourselves.

1221
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,520
We were having a fairly pleasant day.

1222
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,520
Blessed by the...

1223
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,760
Then, how you say?

1224
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,600
Someone rains on our parade?

1225
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,880
Removed one imperialist...

1226
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,600
just to find another.

1227
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,200
This is not the conversation
we should be having right now.

1228
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,760
No?

1229
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,680
What should we talk about?

1230
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,440
I told you.

1231
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,720
There's more bombs on the way.

1232
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,040
Ah,

1233
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:06,560
I'm not interested in your faceless bombs.

1234
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,240
You see, real results

1235
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,920
are created face-to-face,

1236
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,600
interactions like

1237
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,240
what you and I are doing right here.

1238
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,640
Speak!

1239
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,319
Where are the other commandos located?

1240
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,120
There's no more. It's just us!

1241
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,240
Your jets are still in the area.

1242
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,760
Someone must be
communicating with them.

1243
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,400
We were communicating with them.

1244
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,280
Listen,

1245
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,040
there's more strikes on the way.

1246
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,576
If we don't get out of
here, we're all fucking dust.

1247
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,080
No! You are dust!

1248
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,120
Fucking dust!

1249
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,920
How does this feel?

1250
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,920
To be this scared.

1251
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,560
Too weak to do anything
about your own death.

1252
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,440
You may think that I do this

1253
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,720
without feeling anything.

1254
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,720
That is wrong.

1255
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,240
To kill affects me.

1256
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,840
To embrace the
brutality of this affects me.

1257
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,000
And that is the difference
between you and I.

1258
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,880
I look a man in the eye,

1259
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,920
and I make my choice intimate.

1260
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,400
The bomb!

1261
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,440
Excuse me?

1262
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Sir?

1263
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,080
I got this thing here I don't even know...

1264
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,360
I don't even know if this
is something that exists.

1265
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,440
My wife's written it down, so
she might have got it wrong.

1266
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,360
It sounds a little crazy,

1267
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,560
but, uh,

1268
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,240
I gotta ask, you know?

1269
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,920
Do you have

1270
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:14,240
artisanal tree nut fermented
plant-based cashew

1271
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,920
and tahini smoked vegan
new cheese.

1272
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,760
Is that a thing?

1273
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,800
Yeah,

1274
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:20,240
right here.

1275
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,560
Man after my own heart.

1276
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,480
Huh. I would have bet money
against that. Thank you very much.

1277
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,400
All right, let's fucking rock and roll.

1278
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,240
Zoom out 400 meters.

1279
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,800
It's fucking showtime.

1280
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,400
Ready to fire.

1281
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,440
Bombs away.

1282
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,920
Six, five, four, three,

1283
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,880
two, one.

1284
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,360
Impact

1285
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,160
Holy shit.

1286
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,320
You JSOC?

1287
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,440
Can you walk?

1288
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,040
Who are you?

1289
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,720
Who are you?

1290
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:35,640
Hey!

1291
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,120
Fuck!

1292
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,840
Fucking hell, Kinney.

1293
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,040
You good?

1294
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,120
Yeah, yeah.

1295
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:26,920
Who the fuck's that guy?

1296
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,520
The asset...

1297
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:29,760
I think.

1298
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:31,400
Come on. We gotta move.

1299
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,240
So soon?

1300
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,280
Let's go.

1301
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,160
Which way?

1302
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,160
I think it's this way. Let's keep moving.

1303
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,240
Fuck.

1304
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,600
Yeah.

1305
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,520
Okay.

1306
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,320
All right.

1307
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,240
Sit here for a second. I'll be right back.

1308
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:05,079
Boeing 0-1, this is Sunburn 0-6.
You are inbound to target. Five mikes.

1309
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:10,920
Copy incoming. We're hot. Let me
know when I can cross extend at 7-9-8-4-0.

1310
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,760
Fuck,

1311
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,720
fuck, fuck, fuck.

1312
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:24,840
Come on.

1313
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,120
Fuck.

1314
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,480
Barbeque creepy peanuts.

1315
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,799
Yeah!

1316
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,680
Come on!

1317
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,400
Vegan sour cream.

1318
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,280
Come on! Yeah!

1319
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,120
Plant based feta.

1320
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,120
Oh, you motherfucker!

1321
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:49,600
Fuck.

1322
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,040
Come on, man.

1323
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,840
Come on. Pick up the fucking phone.

1324
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:09,640
Get the phone, Sergeant.

1325
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,400
Sergeant!

1326
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,120
Yes, sir.

1327
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,359
Reaper. I need Reaper.

1328
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,400
Reaper's gone.

1329
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,280
Try his cell...

1330
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:22,320
Wait, wait. Hold on.

1331
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:26,040
702-166-42… 00.

1332
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:29,920
Yeah! Come on!

1333
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,560
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

1334
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:33,680
Hello?

1335
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,160
Fuck!

1336
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:45,000
6-42 00.

1337
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,560
Come on, man.

1338
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,600
Pick up the phone.

1339
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:51,320
I'm looking. I'm looking at
all of the shelves. All right.

1340
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,360
Hey,

1341
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:53,880
hold on.

1342
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,480
No, I'm looking at...

1343
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,320
It was a number I didn't know.

1344
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,400
I'm looking at all the shelves,

1345
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:05,040
but they got real Mexican, you know?

1346
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,800
Cou... but with meat in it.

1347
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,040
No, I'm not...

1348
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,000
Baby, okay.

1349
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,296
All right? It's got meat in it.

1350
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:16,160
Sorry I shouldn't have
used the word real.

1351
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,200
Sunburn 0-6, this is Boeing
0-1. Approaching target.

1352
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,560
Come on. Move! Move!

1353
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,600
Okay?

1354
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,519
Tampon because

1355
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,599
I wanted to buy a degradable,

1356
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,800
No problem. Just go right ahead.

1357
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:34,880
Just...

1358
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,800
what's your problem?

1359
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,840
Nothing.

1360
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,480
Okay.

1361
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,200
People is so aggressive...

1362
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,440
Reaper, it's Playboy.
Abort. I need you to abort.

1363
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,839
Abort the last strike. I
need you to abort the last...!

1364
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,840
Fuck!

1365
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,720
Call SitComm.

1366
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,720
I don't understand.

1367
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,199
Call SitComm, for fuck's sake.

1368
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,560
Calling SitComm.

1369
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,280
Yes!

1370
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,080
Come on!

1371
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,400
Yeah!

1372
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,800
Come on, motherfuckers. Answer the phone.

1373
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,920
Lining up for the final run.

1374
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,080
Come on. Call SitComm.

1375
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,160
Come on! Come on!

1376
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,200
Motherfucker,

1377
01:40:26,201 --> 01:40:27,639
answer the fucking phone.

1378
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,640
Come on!

1379
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,920
Come on!

1380
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,560
Oh, fuck it.

1381
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,760
Fuck it!

1382
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,520
Load 0-1 on final approach.

1383
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,160
Come on.

1384
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,160
Move! Move!

1385
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,120
Right there.

1386
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,560
Time to target

1387
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,600
30 seconds.

1388
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,520
Guys!

1389
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,320
Come on, move!

1390
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,200
What the...

1391
01:41:18,201 --> 01:41:20,280
Impact 15 seconds.

1392
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,640
Abort the strike!

1393
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,080
We have payload. Ten seconds.

1394
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:41,440
Seven... six... five...

1395
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:47,680
three, two, one...

1396
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,519
Boeing 0-1, abort!
Boeing 0-1, abort!

1397
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,520
Do you copy?

1398
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,120
What are you doing?

1399
01:41:59,160 --> 01:41:59,760
They copy?

1400
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,120
Yeah.

1401
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:01,640
The operator

1402
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:03,120
is still in the target area.

1403
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,160
Bullshit.

1404
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,080
Zoom in.

1405
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:05,560
Zoom in

1406
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,680
to the caves

1407
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,360
where the strike was gonna be

1408
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,720
There he is. That's him. That's Playboy.

1409
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,040
Sorry, man.

1410
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,240
Goddamn, Reaper.

1411
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,040
Who...

1412
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,240
are you waving at?

1413
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,320
A friend.

1414
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:00,800
Fuck!

1415
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,840
Who won the game?

1416
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:24,760
Vols, baby.

1417
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:26,400
Elite eight.

1418
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:27,880
That's wonderful, Colonel,

1419
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,200
congratulations.

1420
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,440
It's an excellent win for you

1421
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,200
and the great
state of Tennessee.

1422
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,640
That's right.

1423
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,360
I just called that phone

1424
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:42,240
five fucking times.

1425
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,440
Ringer's off again.

1426
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,800
Now it wasn't my pregnant wife.

1427
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:54,040
But it was a life-or-death situation
for a JTAC operator in the field.

1428
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,520
Our job is communication!

1429
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,359
Our priority is protecting
the men and women

1430
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,360
who serve this country.

1431
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,160
So if you don't mind,

1432
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,120
can we get back on
with the fucking job?

1433
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,040
Hell you think you're doing?

1434
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:21,240
You can take that out of my
active-duty bonuses, Colonel.

1435
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,520
Hey, get some sleep.

1436
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:11,800
See you in the morning.

1437
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:12,880
See you then.

1438
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:15,840
Uh...

1439
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,120
you don't own a tux, do you?

1440
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:19,360
A tux?

1441
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,520
I do not own a tux, no.

1442
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,560
Okay.

1443
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:25,400
Wedding is not black tie, right?

1444
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,800
No, not black tie.

1445
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,480
The wedding party is.

1446
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:33,000
Are you gonna ask me to be a bridesmaid?

1447
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,440
No, Reaper.

1448
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,200
I was gonna ask if you want
to walk me down the aisle.

1449
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:44,760
You serious?

1450
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:46,520
Yeah.

1451
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,520
Wow.

1452
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:53,439
That would be one of the
greatest privileges

1453
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,480
of my life.

1454
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,800
You know one thing I know...

1455
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:03,560
one hundred percent for sure.

1456
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,880
Your dad

1457
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,800
would be so proud of you.

1458
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:11,440
Thank you.

1459
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:13,680
So, what are we
going to dance to?

1460
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:14,600
Dance?

1461
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:15,120
Yeah.

1462
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,840
Oh, no, I have not
thought about that yet.

1463
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,720
Okay. Well, you got to pick a song

1464
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,400
and then just listen to my hands.

1465
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,600
I'm gonna listen to your hands?

1466
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:25,560
Oh, yeah. Yes, you are.

1467
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,160
Oh, okay.

1468
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:27,720
Whoa, okay.

1469
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:30,080
Run this round my back.

1470
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:30,400
This?

1471
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,439
- That way, I know where it's coming.
- That's right. There you go.

1472
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:32,880
Okay, what's next?

1473
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,520
Come back in and out.

1474
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,520
Out.

1475
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:36,360
And back to me.

1476
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:36,920
Okay.

1477
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:37,400
Yeah.

1478
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,080
And then out.

1479
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:38,680
Out.

1480
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,879
This time around.

1481
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,199
Give me the other hand.

1482
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:42,200
Oh okay.

1483
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,719
Walking over. Oh, around.

1484
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:44,799
Around my back.

1485
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,880
Beautiful.

1486
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:48,599
You have done this
many, many times before.

1487
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,160
I've had a few Dosey Does.

1488
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,000
Oh, you're pretty good. You're pretty good.

1489
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,479
Any other dances. You know how to twerk?

1490
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,640
To who? To twerk?

1491
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:56,680
To twerk.

1492
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:01,400
- Uh, no. I don't know how to twerk.
- You better get practicing. Yeah.
